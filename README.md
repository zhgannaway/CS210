# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving. 

This project is an interest calculating tool that displays potential user earnings based on the initial deposit, interest rate, number of years, and an optional monthly deposit. The output of the program gives the user two tables of potential earnings, one with a monthly deposit and one without. 

# What did you do particularly well? 

I was particularly proud of the small main function I had in this project. Most of the code lies in the header file I created that handles all the calculations and displays. The main function itself only includes a while loop that continues to pass class functions until the user quits. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? 

The code could have used more input validation, like case sensitivity in the quit function. I did not include any try and catch blocks but instead implemented loops in the functions for input validation. I could have simplified and decluttered the code if I had implemented these concepts in the InvestmentAccount.cpp file. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? 

The most difficult part of this project was the interest calculation. Separating the calculation based on a monthly deposit was the first step. From there it was applying the guidelines provided by the project details but a lot of testing. Observing the outputs of my code next to the expected outputs helped me understand where I was going wrong with the code. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? 

Problem solving and persistence were the key skills I could take with me for my future projects. This course had me testing code a lot and finding more ways to debug my programs. It solidified basic programming principles while teaching me another language. I was challenged in this course with finding ways to overcome coding obstacles, but I continued to try and eventually arrived at a functioning program. With much more to add, this functioning program is still not complete.
